# ================================================
# This file lists all the required Python packages for the SmartLendXAI project.


# Core Libraries for Data Handling
pandas         # For structured data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames)
numpy          # For numerical operations, linear algebra, arrays

# Data Visualization Libraries
matplotlib     # For basic plotting and charting
seaborn        # For statistical data visualization (built on matplotlib)

#provides tools for handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning, particularly in classification tasks where the distribution of classes is uneven
imbalanced-learn==0.11.0 # For handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning (e.g., SMOTE, ADASYN)

# Machine Learning Framework
scikit-learn==1.3.2   # Core ML algorithms, preprocessing, model evaluation

# Console Output Enhancement
termcolor      # For printing colored messages in the console (e.g., model success)

# Explainable AI (XAI) Tools
shap           # SHAP values for model explainability (tree-based & linear models)
lime           # LIME for local interpretability of black-box models
eli5           # Model inspection and debugging (especially linear models and pipelines)

# Utilities
setuptools     # Helps in packaging Python projects and managing dependencies

# Advanced Gradient Boosting Algorithms
xgboost        # eXtreme Gradient Boosting â€“ powerful, scalable boosting framework
lightgbm       # Fast and efficient gradient boosting (by Microsoft)
catboost       # Gradient boosting library that natively handles categorical features

# Required for displaying LIME results in notebooks
ipython       # Needed for IPython.core.display
jupyter       # If using Jupyter Notebooks
